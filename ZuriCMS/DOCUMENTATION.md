## **CMS Overview**

CMS stands for a content management system, it’s an application that enables users to be able to create, organize, modify, manage and publish various content,  
including documents, digital content (e.g photos, audio, and video files), and web content.

### **Why You Should Choose a CMS**

- No coding knowledge is required: Creating a personalized website using a cms software application doesn’t require you to have any prior knowledge of any of the programming languages because you are just to choose from an already made template and do a simple tweaking so it can fit to what you have in mind.
- Easy to update: You can always change templates at any time e.g if there was an update on the cms site and some new templates were released and you love them, you can always change the template.
- Speedy update of content: Once a change is made on the content your website should have, the content you updated gets changed instantaneously without any delay.
- Ability to create more than a page: It’s a software application that allows users to create multiple pages for their website to accommodate more content they want their website to have.

 Speaking of our cms web app it’s a web app that allows the user to create a website for their organizations whether start-ups or well-established companies that just want something classy at the same time and up to standard, and that can be achieved by choosing a template from the available template and also there’s a privilege to edit it to your taste - the beauty.

## **CMS Features**
